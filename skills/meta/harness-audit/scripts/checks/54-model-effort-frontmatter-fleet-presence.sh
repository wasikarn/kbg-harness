# Convention: docs/reference/skill-authoring-conventions.md "Explicit model: + effort: on
# every surface (fleet convention, v0.68.430)" — all agents/*.md and
# skills/*/SKILL.md ship with explicit model: and
# effort:. This check enforces presence + value sanity, deliberately NOT the
# per-surface tier map: tiers are a judgment call that legitimately changes
# with a version bump, and freezing them here would turn every retier into a
# two-file edit for zero drift-catch value.
#
#   - either key missing               -> WARN (a new/edited surface dropped the convention)
#   - effort not low|medium|high|xhigh    -> WARN (max is a valid Claude Code value but
#     the fleet assigns it no tier: unbounded spend on a shipped agent; v1.1.54)
#   - skill/command model != inherit   -> WARN unless the surface runs context: fork
#     (a concrete pin on a main-thread surface switches the session model for the
#     REST OF THE TURN — official skills.md frontmatter reference)
#
# Agent model VALUES are check 21's job — only presence is checked here.
# skills/*/references/*.md fragments stay unstamped by design (check 42 owns
# the reference-file frontmatter class).
#
# WARN (not CRIT): convention drift, not the tamper-sensitive class 36/40/45 guard.
