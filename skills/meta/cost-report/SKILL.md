# Cost Report

Print and read back the spend summary that the plugin's own Stop hook accumulates in
`~/.local/share/kbg/metrics/costs.jsonl`. It covers every session on this machine that ran
with the `stop:cost-tracker` hook, across all projects, with subagent spend split out by agent
type. Native `/usage` (alias `/cost`) covers the live session per model and, on a subscription, a
24h/7d attribution share; this is the per-day, per-agent-type dollar history it lacks.

## Run

One Bash call. The script reads the log, dedups it, and prints the report; do not open the
log yourself or add up rows by hand.

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cost-report-dedup.js"
```

`/cost-report csv` appends `csv` and prints the last 100 raw rows instead of the summary.

`MH_COSTS_FILE=<path>` points the script at another log; use it only when the user or the
task names a log outside the default location.

If the file is missing, the script prints `Cost tracker not set up` and exits 0. Relay that
line: the log fills after the first session ends with the hook enabled. Do not invent numbers.
If `node` is missing, say so; the report has no other runtime.

## Read back

Quote the script's numbers as printed. Add only what a reader needs to interpret them:

- **Whole machine, not this project.** Every project writes to the same log and the report never
  groups by project. Compare a trend over days, not one total against another project.
- **`note:` lines first.** Rows written before 2026-09-04 summed tokens per transcript line,
  so their turns, tokens, and cost run about 2.4x high; a short run after that kept a streaming
  placeholder and reads about 39% low on output. The script does not rewrite either era, so a
  total that mixes eras is a ceiling, not a bill. Say which note applies before quoting `total`.
- **`(rate unverified)` means guessed.** A Claude model the tracker has no rate table for is
  priced at the Sonnet rate. Rank those models by the `tok` column, not by dollars.
- **Non-Claude models are history.** Proxy-served models (minimax, glm, kimi, nemotron) only
  appear in rows from before 2026-08-07; the tracker drops them now.
- **Subagent spend starts 2026-08-07.** Earlier rows are orchestrator-only, so a before/after
  difference across that date is a schema change, not a spending change.
- **Codex invocations are counts.** Codex exposes no local per-call price, so that section
  never has a dollar column; it is absent until a session has used `codex:*`.

Never re-estimate prices from raw tokens. `estimated_cost_usd` is the tracker's number; the
rate table lives in `hooks/stop/cost-tracker.sh` and changes there.

## Data model and dedup rule

Row schema, the three legacy eras, and the aggregation key the report must keep are in
`references/data-model.md`. The rule that must not regress: for each session, keep the latest
row per (`session_id`, `stream`, `model`, `agent_type`) and sum across keys; a legacy row with
no `stream` counts as `orchestrator`. `tests/skills/test-cost-report.sh` pins every element of
that key with a wrong-answer fixture; run it after any change to the script.
