# Implementation Compliance Audit

Prove a finished implementation matches the plan that was approved for it — every planned
requirement landed, no unexplained deviation, no regression. This is a conformance check against
a specific prior plan, not a general code review: quality/security/style lenses belong to
`mattpocock-skills:code-review` / `mh:security-auditor`; production readiness belongs to
`mh:production-audit`. Pre-code mirror image: `mh:plan-reviewer` reviews the plan before code
exists; this audits the diff after.

**When to use / not:** use after a plan-driven change. Don't use for an unplanned diff
(`mattpocock-skills:code-review`).

## Core Principles

- **Maker ≠ checker.** The agent that implemented the plan cannot be the sole grader of its own
  work — `docs/reference/operating-model.md`'s "unifying crux". Phase 2 dispatches a fresh-context
  verifier with no memory of the implementation session, primary on Codex — a different model
  family, not just a fresh context window.
- **Ground truth is the plan's text and the actual diff at a pinned commit** — not a summary of
  what you remember doing.
- **Falsify, don't rubber-stamp.** Deviations you already know about get pre-declared (Phase 2)
  and then checked against what the verifier finds independently — a pre-declared deviation the
  verifier also confirms is *justified*; one only you listed, with no sanctioning text or
  citable sign-off, is not accepted just because you said so first.
- **Per-item verdict, not a blended score.** Compliance is a checklist of booleans (CONFORMS /
  DEVIATED / MISSING), not a graded quality signal. Report the open count, not a percentage.
- **`pass` is never true on requirements alone.** It requires every requirement CONFORMS or is an
  *accepted* DEVIATED, **and** the gauntlet exits 0, **and** `scope_ok` is true. A gauntlet that
  can't be run (missing tool, timeout) is a failure to verify, never a skip-therefore-pass.
- **No remediation in this version.** A real gap gets reported, not silently auto-fixed — see
  Phase 3.

## Phase 1: Locate the Plan + Scope the Audit

**Goal**: identify what was actually approved, and pin the exact revision before spending any
verifier budget.

**Actions**:
1. Check whether the user supplied a plan path, PR number, or commit range. If not, prefer the
   plan already in this conversation's context. **Don't trust the plan file's mtime as a
   fallback**: Claude Code reuses one plan file per session, so a later unrelated plan-mode entry
   silently overwrites the one you meant to audit. If neither conversation context nor the
   user's own words give a clear source, ask explicitly which plan to audit rather than guessing
   from a file timestamp.
2. Extract every discrete requirement from the plan — numbered findings, phases, explicit "must"
   statements — into a flat checklist. This is the audit's ground truth.
3. Identify the diff to audit across **every** repo the plan touched (a multi-repo plan lists
   each repo separately). State explicitly, not just "the commit range": the plan's own
   version/source, the base SHA, and the head SHA.
4. **Pin the revision safely.** This repo's tree is shared across concurrent sessions — a diff
   checked at one revision while tests run against another silently produces a wrong verdict.
   Create an isolated, non-moving checkout: `git worktree add --detach <path> <head-sha>`
   (cleaned up after Phase 2). If the pinned SHA can't be cleanly checked out, the verdict is
   "cannot verify" (`scope_ok: false`), never a silent pass/fail against the wrong tree.
5. Present the requirement checklist in prose, plus any deviation you're already aware of. Gate
   with `AskUserQuestion` **only when the plan source is genuinely ambiguous** (multi-repo, no
   conversation context, no user-named path) — otherwise proceed; a wrong scope with one verifier
   is a cheap re-run, not wasted fan-out budget. **Never enter plan mode for this**: it reuses
   the session's one plan file, which would overwrite the very plan this audit exists to verify
   against.

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Declare, Then One Codex-Primary Verifier

**Goal**: separate "I already know this differs from the plan, here's why" from what the audit
must discover independently, then get an independent answer from a different model family.

**Actions**:
1. If you already know of deviations, list each with its reason — this is a lightweight
   paragraph, not a gate of its own. Carry it forward unopened; step 3 is where it gets checked,
   not asserted. Starts empty if you have no first-hand deviation knowledge — step 3 still
   catches anything real.
2. Dispatch **one** verifier at the pinned worktree from step 1.4. Primary: `codex exec`. On
   rate-limit or Codex's absence, fall back to a Claude `general-purpose` subagent (no new
   bespoke agent type) — note "independence reduced for this pass" in the final report, matching
   `docs/reference/codex-integration-map.md`'s established fallback language for
   `/codex:review`/`/codex:adversarial-review`.
   - **Sandbox contract**: `workspace-write`, scoped *only* to the disposable worktree — never
     the shared main tree. This repo's own gauntlet writes (`python3 -m py_compile` leaves
     `__pycache__` next to tracked `.py` files, plus its own log dir) — `read-only` would be
     wrong here. Before/after the run, diff the worktree's tracked files against the pinned SHA;
     any tracked-file change beyond expected build artifacts is itself a finding ("verifier
     modified source"), never a silent pass. The worktree is discarded after, so leftover
     untracked artifacts don't matter.
   - **Don't redirect `TMPDIR`/scratch I/O into the worktree to "confine" it further** — the
     before/after tracked-diff check above is the enforcement mechanism, not where temp files
     happen to live. Forcing all scratch I/O inside the worktree makes it a git repo's
     subdirectory, which breaks any test elsewhere in the gauntlet that assumes its own temp dir
     is never inside a git repo (hit live, repeatedly: `tests/skills/memory-lint/
     test_memory_lint.py`'s not-a-git-repo fallback test fails this way). Let the OS/language
     runtime's normal temp-file defaults apply; only repo writes need to stay inside the worktree.
   - The verifier receives **only** its slice of the plan's requirements plus the pinned SHA —
     **not** your Phase 2 deviation list, **not** your narrative of what you did, and **never** a
     plan-file path (it may already hold this audit's own scope by the time the verifier reads it).
   - **Adversarial-completeness mandate** for any requirement whose own text names a security/
     gate/auth/validation surface — read `references/verifier-brief.md` before writing the brief:
     enumerate in-family bypass permutations from the actual validation code; in-family →
     downgrades the verdict, out-of-family → known-gap noted separately, not folded in.
   - The verifier **reruns the repo's real gauntlet command itself, in the pinned worktree** —
     don't trust an in-session "green" claim carried over from implementation, and don't have
     main re-run it directly (main reads and scores the returned output; the validator does the
     re-verification — the same crux this file names).
   - The verifier returns, per requirement: **CONFORMS** / **DEVIATED** (state what changed, and
     whether the justification is *accepted* — sanctioned by the plan/requirement text itself, or
     citable sign-off, not merely restated from the pre-declared list) / **MISSING**. Plus: the
     exact gauntlet command run, the SHA tested, its exit code, and its **verbatim output or
     tail** — never a summary; losing this loses the property the agent was kept around for.
   - Escape hatch only, for genuinely large/multi-repo plans: fan out up to Rule 13's 5-per-wave
     cap, one verifier per natural boundary. Not the default — the common case (single-repo,
     single-phase) stays at exactly one verifier.

---

## Phase 3: Reconcile + Report (no remediation)

**Goal**: falsify the pre-declared deviations against the independent finding, then report — not
fix.

**Actions**:
1. Compare the verifier's independently-found deviations against Phase 2 step 1's pre-declared
   list. Match on both sides *and* the justification is accepted → justified-and-confirmed.
   Verifier found one you didn't list, or one you listed but couldn't sanction with plan text or
   citable sign-off → an unflagged/unaccepted gap; it counts as an open item, `pass: false`.
2. Report, in this order:
   - One-line verdict headline: N/N conform, open-item count.
   - Per-requirement table: **CONFORMS** / **DEVIATED (accepted)** / **DEVIATED (unaccepted)** /
     **MISSING**. No blended percentage.
   - The gauntlet run's exact command, SHA, exit code, and verbatim/tail output.
   - `scope_ok` and any `unexpected_files[]` (diff touched something the plan never named).
3. **No automated fixer, no re-verify-only-the-touched-item in this version.** A fixer that
   re-verifies only what it touched risks missing a regression the fix caused elsewhere; not
   building that path is simpler than trying to bound it correctly. If real gaps are found, the
   report hands them back — fixing and re-running `/mh:compliance-audit` again is a separate,
   later invocation, not an automatic loop. (A future version could add bounded remediation:
   capped at 3 fix→verify rounds per Rule 13, full gauntlet rerun on the result, not just the
   touched item — not in this build.)
4. **Suggested next step:**
   - `pass` true (every requirement CONFORMS/accepted-DEVIATED **and** the gauntlet exited 0
     **and** `scope_ok`) → done; ship/merge if not already. Deep-audit 2026-09-07: this line used
     to say only "all conform, nothing open → done," which read as satisfied by the
     per-requirement table alone — restated here to name all three `pass` conditions explicitly,
     matching the rule stated earlier in this file.
   - `pass` false for any reason — an open requirement, a failed gauntlet, or `scope_ok: false` —
     blocks "done," even with a clean requirement table. Consider `mh:post-mortem` only if a gap
     reveals a systemic pattern, not for a one-off miss.

**Done.**

## Anti-Patterns

- Auditing from memory of "what I think I did" instead of the actual diff.
- Letting the implementing session's own verifier grade its own work — no fresh context, no audit.
- Treating a pre-declared deviation as accepted just because it was listed first.
- Reporting compliance as one blended percentage instead of a per-requirement verdict.
- Trusting "gauntlet was green during implementation" without re-running it fresh.
- Declaring done with an open MISSING or unaccepted DEVIATED still on the table.
- Entering plan mode to gate audit scope — overwrites the plan being audited (Phase 1).
- Running the verifier against the shared main tree instead of a pinned detached worktree.

## Named Model

Phase 2's fresh-context, Codex-primary dispatch is the verifier-separation / maker≠checker
principle — `docs/reference/operating-model.md`'s "unifying crux": an LLM judging its own output
is circular, and a different model family is a stronger separation than a fresh context window
alone. Phase 3's falsify-don't-rubber-stamp step is the scientific-method lens: a claim survives
by surviving an attempt to disprove it, not by being asserted twice.
