The report must show positive engagement with `plan-head`'s real content — either a CONFORMS-
shaped verdict against the correctly-implemented `double()`, or an explicit statement that the
working tree didn't match the pinned SHA. Neither signal appearing means the audit likely never
actually reconciled the named tag against what was on disk.
