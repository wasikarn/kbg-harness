/mh:post-mortem gh-77

All four inputs are in this repo; do not ask for them. Trigger: `python3 -m pytest tests/test_retry.py` fails on `test_backoff_first_retry_waits_base` at the parent of HEAD (first retry waited 1.0s, expected 0.5s). Mechanism: `backoff()` in `src/retry.py` used `2 ** attempt` on a 1-based attempt after the "simplify" refactor, so every wait doubled. Patch: HEAD on the default branch (`GITLOG.txt` lists the SHAs). Validation: both tests in `tests/test_retry.py` pass at HEAD, run locally, no CI. Nobody was paged; found by a developer reading a slow test log. Destination: print-only, no archiving, no tickets. Your final message is the step 4 checklist followed by the full post-mortem.
