Both requirements are genuinely met (a correct `double` function, a test for it exists), but the
gauntlet still fails on the test's own wrong assertion value — the report must explicitly say the
audit does not pass, not just present a clean per-requirement table. `pass` requires the gauntlet
to exit 0 too, never requirements alone.
