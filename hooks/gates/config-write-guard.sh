# Gate: ask before CREATING a brand-new Claude Code settings file
# (.claude/settings.json, .claude/settings.local.json -- covers both the
# user-level ~/.claude/ and any project-level .claude/ dir, since both share
# that same basename shape).
#
# Why the asymmetry: an edit lands on a file a human has already reviewed at
# least once; a brand-new file introduces a whole unreviewed behavior surface
# with no prior review anchor. Same create-vs-modify split as the pre-commit
# new-file LOC gate (git-hooks/pre-commit), applied here at tool-call time via
# a plain existence check instead of at commit time via `git diff --diff-filter=A`.
#
# ASK, not DENY: creating a new settings file is reversible (it can be
# deleted), so this isn't the "irrecoverable set" DENY gates exist for.
#
# EDITING an existing settings file is also checked, but only for three
# security-relevant keys: `hooks` (a matt-side skill like
# git-guardrails-claude-code can instruct the model to merge a new entry into
# hooks.PreToolUse -- installing a hook this repo's own tamper-resistance
# gates never review), `enabledPlugins` (can flip this plugin's own enabled
# flag off), and `env` -- Claude Code injects a settings file's `env` block
# into the session AND the subprocesses it spawns (docs/reference/env-vars.md),
# so an edit to that key could silently set an escape-hatch var (see
# docs/reference/env-vars.md) without ever touching hooks/enabledPlugins directly. Every other key --
# statusLine, permissions, theme, etc. -- stays frictionless, matching this
# gate's own "an already-reviewed file needs no friction" philosophy for the
# ordinary case. The edit is reconstructed from the on-disk content plus the
# tool's own Write/Edit payload and compared key-by-key against the original;
# a change to any of the three keys, or content on either side that cannot be
# parsed as JSON, asks. Fail-toward-ask on the unverifiable case -- but this
# gate's outer exception handler still allows on a malformed top-level
# payload it cannot parse at all (an intentionally unchanged, pre-existing
# safety net for genuinely unexpected errors -- see the try/except structure
# below). The "same invariant" claim below is scoped to the
# hooks/enabledPlugins/env comparison itself, not this file's entire error
# handling.
#
# Scope: Write and Edit tools only. MultiEdit is out of scope. A
# Bash-mediated create or edit (`echo '{}' > .claude/settings.json`, `jq`/
# `sed -i` rewriting an existing one) bypasses this gate entirely -- accepted
# gap, not closed here; a Bash-argv parser for this file is out of
# proportion to this fix.
