# mentions do not trip it; the flag scan is quote-aware so a separator inside a
# quoted prompt does not end it early. re.MULTILINE: a line inside an
# interpreter-fed heredoc body is its own statement.
# GH #152: `claude\b` alone matched mid-token (a path like /tmp/claude-501/...
# contains a word-bounded "claude", since "-" is a non-word char), and the
# forward flag scan did not stop at a newline, so a later unrelated line's
# flag (e.g. `mkdir -p`) got attributed to that false match. Fixed by
# requiring "claude" to end the token -- next char must not be an
# identifier/path-continuation char (word char, "-", ".", "/") -- and by
# treating an unquoted newline as a scan-stopping separator, same as &/;/|.
# A code-review round on the first attempt caught two dangerous-direction
# regressions before ship, both since covered by tests below: (1) an
# allowlist-shaped exclusion (only \s;&|) rejected legitimate shell
# metacharacters too, e.g. missing `claude>out.log -p x`; a denylist of
# continuation chars is the correct shape. (2) a bare newline-stops-scan rule
# also stopped at a backslash-continued newline (`claude \` + real newline +
# `-p`), which is still ONE shell statement -- the scan now treats a
# `\`-then-newline pair as non-breaking, matching how a real shell (and this
# file's own _newlines_to_seps, used elsewhere) treats line continuations.
# ponytail: only single-backslash continuation is tracked, not escape parity
# (`\\` + newline, an even count, is NOT a continuation in real bash but is
# treated as one here) -- habit-guard, not adversarial sandbox, same posture
# as this file's other documented one-level-only unwraps.
# ponytail: `cat <<EOF | bash` bodies are stripped as inert and not scanned,
# add heredoc-body scanning if a nested-spawn bypass via heredoc is ever demonstrated.
