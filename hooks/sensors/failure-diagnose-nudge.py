"""PostToolUseFailure(Bash) sensor: on a Bash failure, injects a
diagnose-before-retry nudge back into the same turn. Never blocks (always
exit 0) -- this is advisory only, not a gate. GH #153. Registered only on
PostToolUseFailure: a real Bash failure dispatches via that event in this CC
version, not PostToolUse (confirmed live, deep-audit 2026-09-07) -- a
PostToolUse registration would only ever see successful calls (exit_code 0),
so it was dropped rather than kept as an always-no-op.

Capped at 3 nudges per distinct failing command per session (METHODOLOGY
Rule 13's bounded-retry doctrine: "stop after 3 rounds, the fault is then in
the plan, not the unit") via a small session-scoped counter file -- the fleet's
first stateful hook, deliberately narrow in scope: a local rate-limit on one
advisory nudge, not a cross-agent orchestration layer.

Fires on every non-zero exit (no denylist of "worth nudging on" patterns) --
a deliberate first cut, narrowing to specific failure shapes is left for a
follow-up if the noise turns out to matter in practice.
