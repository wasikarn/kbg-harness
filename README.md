# matt-harness

A Claude Code plugin (`mh@wasikarn`). It adds only what native Claude Code and the plugins it
sits next to (`mattpocock-skills`, `ponytail`, `diagram-design`, `qmd`) can't already do: 6
deny/ask gates, a 4 KB methodology injected at session start, and a small set of skills and
agents that earned their place.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add wasikarn/matt-harness
/plugin install mh@wasikarn
claude plugin enable mh@wasikarn                 # from a terminal

# Required: matt-pocock's skills as their own plugin (routed by name, not bundled)
/plugin marketplace add mattpocock/skills
/plugin install mattpocock-skills@mattpocock

# Restart Claude Code, then once per project you want the harness active in:
/mattpocock-skills:setup-matt-pocock-skills

/mh:cost-report                                  # smoke test; skills are namespaced /mh:<name>
claude plugin list                               # both plugins "enabled"
```

The plugin ships `defaultEnabled: false`; add `"mh@wasikarn": true` to `settings.json` if
`enable` did not. Same-version edits never reach the cache — bump `plugin.json` before
`claude plugin update`. Uninstall: `/plugin uninstall mh@wasikarn`.

## The 6 gates (`hooks/hooks.json`)

| gate | effect |
|---|---|
| `gate:bash:irrecoverable` | denies `rm -rf`, `find -delete`, `--no-verify`, `push --force`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, discarding `restore`/`checkout`, `branch -D`, `stash drop/clear`, `commit --amend`, `dd`, SQL `DROP`, `git add -A` outside a merge, nested `claude` spawns from a subagent |
| `gate:bash:subagent-git-guard` | denies `git stash`/`reset`/`clean` from a dispatched subagent |
| `gate:task:complete-separation` | denies a subagent marking its own task complete |
| `gate:write:test-integrity` | asks before a write that weakens a test |
| `gate:write:config-guard` | asks before a write to Claude Code settings `hooks`/`enabledPlugins` |
| `gate:skill:codex-setup-guard` | asks before a model-invoked `--enable-review-gate` call to the paired Codex plugin's `/codex:setup` |

Each is its own PreToolUse entry with an 8 s timeout. Claude Code runs matching hooks in
parallel and merges deny > ask > allow (verified empirically 2026-09-05); a timed-out gate does
not block.

## What it injects

`docs/METHODOLOGY.md` (under 4 KB) at SessionStart: the decision-sizing triad, interrogate the
claim, bug fix = failing test first, context economy and delegation (5 agents per wave, a fresh
validator for a dispatched builder's multi-file work, `NEEDS-DECISION` instead of guessing),
score not feel. `git-hooks/pre-commit` refuses a `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` over 4096 bytes.

## What it ships

- **Skills:** `mh:harness-audit` (28 structural checks), `mh:memory-lint`, `mh:cost-report`,
  `mh:deep-audit`, `mh:ideate`, `mh:post-mortem`, `mh:tech-humanize`.
- **Agents (9):** backend-architect, blind-spot-hunter, code-architect, ideate-critic,
  nextjs-reviewer, performance-optimizer, plan-reviewer, requirement-analyst,
  silent-failure-hunter. Generic TS review and security review go to
  `mattpocock-skills:code-review` and native `/security-review` instead — reviewers here are
  read-only and never grant `Agent`.
- **Stop hooks:** `cost-tracker.sh` (per-session token cost to `~/.local/share/kbg/metrics/costs.jsonl`),
  `memory-audit-commit.sh` (commits a git-backed memory store, opt-in).
- **Optional pairing:** `codex@openai-codex`, installed separately and routed to by name for a
  second opinion from a different model family — see below.

## Architecture: the 6-layer harness

| layer | where it lives in mh |
|---|---|
| 1 Task contract | `docs/reference/spawn-brief.md` + the `NEEDS-DECISION` sentinel |
| 2 Context compiler | `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` (4 KB map, size gated in pre-commit) + `CLAUDE.md` |
| 3 Tool gateway | `hooks/hooks.json` PreToolUse entries, one per gate script in `hooks/gates/` (native deny > ask > allow; a gate timeout = allow) |
| 4 Durable state | native auto-memory owns it; mh adds `skills/meta/memory-lint` + `costs.jsonl` |
| 5 Evidence gate | `scripts/run-gauntlet.sh` + `skills/meta/harness-audit` + gates `test-integrity` and `task-complete-separation` (maker never grades its own work) |
| 6 Trace + recovery | Claude Code's own transcript is the run trace (tool calls, context loaded, changes made) — mh doesn't duplicate it. `hooks/stop/cost-tracker.sh` adds cost/token accounting on top; `skills/workflow/post-mortem` is the recovery loop, classifying each fix into the article's own four failure classes |

## Optional: pairing with Codex

`codex@openai-codex` (Apache-2.0) pairs as a second, independent coding agent — a different
model family, routed to by name, never wrapped or orchestrated. Install separately
(`/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc`, `/plugin install codex@openai-codex`,
`/codex:setup`); mh works unchanged without it. Routing, the gate gap, and the `AGENTS.md`
pointer: `docs/reference/codex-integration-map.md`.

## Development

```bash
bash skills/meta/harness-audit/scripts/audit.sh   # the real structural gate
bash scripts/run-gauntlet.sh                       # validate + lint + every test under tests/
claude plugin validate . --strict                  # manifest shape only
git config core.hooksPath git-hooks   # relative path; pre-commit = fast gate, pre-push = gauntlet
```
